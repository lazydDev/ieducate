                    skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                    storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance
                    of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or
                    informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or
                    acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

                <p class="lead">Although many people still consider traditional universities as the best
                    way to achieve knowledge and get a diploma, online learning proves to be a great alternative.
                    Students
                    have the chance to study in their own time and especially for free. It represents a great way to
                    study
                    many fields and to boost the level of self-motivation. Online learning is so effective because
                    students
                    can finish their homework quickly, and there is more time left for hobbies or for finding a job.

                    An access to all resources of a traditional course helps participants learn wherever they are,
                    leaving
                    them the freedom to choose the time for study. With basically an Internet connection, a person can
                    attend different courses. Among the advantages of online learning there are the responsibility and
                    self-discipline of students.</p>

                <p class="lead">Educational technology (commonly abbreviated as EduTech, or EdTech) is the combined use
                    of computer hardware, software, and educational theory and practice to facilitate learning. When
                    referred to with its abbreviation, EdTech, it is often referring to the industry of companies that
                    create educational technology. In addition to practical educational experience, educational
                    technology is based on theoretical knowledge from various disciplines such as communication,
                    education, psychology, sociology, artificial intelligence, and computer science. It encompasses
                    several domains including learning theory, computer-based training, online
                    learning, and m-learning, where mobile technologies are used.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Let's Grow Together</h2>
                <p class="lead">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills
                    deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
                    imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As
                    cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through
                    imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                    Kingdom. Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements
                    published in 1607 Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in
                    Europe. The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens
                    as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in
                    the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization
                    following the fall of Rome in CE 476. In China, Confucius (551–479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was
                    the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence
                    the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples
                    and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects
                    were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the
                    modern era.</p>
